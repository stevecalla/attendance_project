Objective:
Develop a Retool application to simulate a basic attendance management dashboard using dummy data provided by Retool. 

Deadline: Please complete the Retool project on or before 5/6/2024. Once completed, please invite me to the project using my email address: pat@safermgmt.com for evaluation.

Requirements:

Data Display:

Table Structure: Create a table component in Retool with columns representing various attributes of attendance data such as Student Name, Section Name, Period, Teacher, Event Date, and Status.

Dummy Data: Utilize Retool's ability to generate dummy data to populate the table initially. This can include fictional student names, section names, teachers, dates, and statuses (e.g., present, absent).

Dynamic Data: Ensure that the table can dynamically adjust its content based on user interactions, such as filtering and sorting.

Filtering and Sorting:

Filter Options: Implement dropdown menus or input fields to allow users to filter attendance records based on criteria such as Teacher, Section Name, or Date.

Sorting Functionality: Enable users to sort attendance records based on different attributes like Student Name, Event Date, or Status. This can be achieved through clickable column headers that toggle between ascending and descending order.

Data Manipulation:

Layout Design: Design the dashboard layout in a visually appealing and intuitive manner. Ensure that components are arranged logically and efficiently use screen real estate.

Responsive Design: Test the dashboard on various screen sizes and devices to ensure that it remains functional and visually pleasing. Utilize Retool's responsive layout features to adapt the dashboard as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Functionality: Does the application display dummy attendance data correctly and allow for basic manipulation?
User Experience: Is the application easy to use and navigate?
Data Handling: Does the application correctly simulate data manipulation actions such as marking students present or absent?
User Interface: Is the dashboard visually appealing and responsive?
